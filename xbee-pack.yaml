  The Autoconf package contains programs for producing shell scripts that can automatically configure source code.
  Installed programs: autoconf, autoheader, autom4te, autoreconf, autoscan, autoupdate, and ifnames
  Installed directory: /usr/share/autoconf
  Short Descriptions:
    autoconf: Produces shell scripts that automatically configure software source code packages to adapt to many kinds of Unix-like systems; the configuration scripts it produces are independentâ€”running them does not require the autoconf program
    autoheader: A tool for creating template files of C #define statements for configure to use
    autom4te: A wrapper for the M4 macro processor
    autoreconf: Automatically runs autoconf, autoheader, aclocal, automake, gettextize, and libtoolize in the correct order to save time when changes are made to autoconf and automake template files
    autoscan: Helps to create a configure.in file for a software package; it examines the source files in a directory tree, searching them for common portability issues, and creates a configure.scan file that serves as as a preliminary configure.in file for the package
    autoupdate: Modifies a configure.in file that still calls autoconf macros by their old names to use the current macro names
    ifnames: Helps when writing configure.in files for a software package; it prints the identifiers that the package uses in C preprocessor conditionals [If a package has already been set up to have some portability, this program can help determine what configure needs to check for. It can also fill in gaps in a configure.in file generated by autoscan.]
